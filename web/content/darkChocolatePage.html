                Dark chocolate is rich in minerals, such as iron, magnesium, and zinc.<br>
                it can have various health benefits, including reducing inflammation and decreasing<br>
                the risk of heart disease.

                                which might prevent or combat diabetes.

                                Flavonols in dark chocolate have a positive impact<br>

                                and stronger memory. Though research is ongoing, one reason for this may be<br>
                                that flavonols increase blood flow to the brain.

                                The epicatechin in dark chocolate increases<br>
                                the production of nitric oxide in the blood, which supports circulation<br>
                                and reduces the amount of oxygen an athlete uses while engaged<br>
                                in moderately intense exercise. This allows the athlete to maintain workout<br>
                                intensity for longer.

                                People who ate dark chocolate reported that they felt less stressed,<br>
                                and researchers confirmed that after eating dark chocolate, there were reduced<br>
                                levels of the stress hormone cortisol. This may be related to dark chocolate’s effects<br>
                                on heart health, since stress is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease.
